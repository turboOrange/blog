# 👋 About Me

Hey there! I'm a developer who loves building cool stuff on the web.

## What I Do

- 🚀 Build web applications that don't suck
- 🎨 Design interfaces that make people smile
- 🤖 Automate boring tasks
- ✨ Experiment with wacky ideas

## Philosophy

> "Make it work, make it right, make it **ridiculously good looking**."

I believe code should be functional *and* fun. Life's too short for boring websites!

## Tech I Love

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS that actually works
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, whatever gets the job done
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, Terminal with cool colors

## Currently

Building this blog and experimenting with terminal-style UIs. Pretty meta, right?
