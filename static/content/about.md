# About Me

Hi! :) It always feels strange to self describe. I'll try.
I'm a curious individual that happen to be really into electronics and computing.

## What I Do At Work

### Damotech
I worked at Damotech. I'm a QA there.
Basically, I tested changes that devs receive straight from copilot (jk, they are good devs.)
and I make automated tests to make sure things don't break without notice.

### GSI
I was a software developer in test at GSI now grain and protein technology.
the test system was more complex cause it was hardware in the loop.
I was writing automated tests, maintaining internal APIs, working on internal tooling.

## What Brings me joy
I'm someone that love building stuff.
What I like the most I would say is embedded, compilers/interpreters, and web development.
I think my coolest personal project yet is spinashlang, a quantum language. I'm still working on it.

Aside from the builder part of me. I love horror. I read and watch a lot of horror.
If I would choose one movie to be my favorite right now, I think I would go with annihilation. 
That movie make something terrifying can also be beautiful. If you havn't get it yet, I'm really into cosmic horror.

Univercity took a lot of my time so I kinda stopped for some years that art part of myself.
I'm slowly getting back to it. I like to write and draw so I have some ideas of making a horror zine for fun.
Let's see how that goes.

## Studies and the perks they give me
### DEP electronic repair 
That's a really useful one not for actually having a job but for just being able to fix your own stuff.
It also gave me a better understanding of what design is easy to repair and wha isn't
Just knowing how to solder can also be really useful in some projects.

To 100% honest. I took this course when I was a kid cause even if I was already writing some C, I didn't have enough
I didn't think developing code was accessible for me somehow.
I also imagined what kind of skill would be useful in a post apo setup and it was the coolest of them all.

### DEC Electronic computer and networks
That one mixes electronics, software and networking like the name says but almost perfectly split.
The software part was some embedded C, C++, PHP, BASH.
The network part was a long course from CISCO with Windows server *spit* and AD.
The electronic part was about electronic basic design, microcontrollers, CPLD, 
ampops and how to use the oscilloscope and signal analyzer.
It was a very versatile program.

### B. Sc. A in computer science
I really liked the UQAM program.
I took optional courses in cybersecurity, creating programing languages, UX design.
There was also optional courses that I had to take outside the program.
I took a course on the history of homosexuality. That way I can come out just by showing my certificate.
I also had one in sign language (LSQ). I wish I could continue those. Maybe one day?
