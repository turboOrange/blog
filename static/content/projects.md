# My Projects

Here's what I'm working on (or have worked on).

### Personal Blog
**Status**: Active  
**Tech**: Docusaurus, React, TypeScript, CSS  
**Description**: This very site! I had a simple one made in raw HTML/CSS/JS but now docusaurus gives me super powers.

**Features**:
- Interactive terminal commands with blog page navigation
- Some ester eggs here and there
- three cute ghosts that mooves around on the page to slow you down just a bit. You can grab and move if needed.
- A normal Docusaurus style blog if you don't want to use the pesky terminal
- Some actual blog posts
